First of all welcome to the guide of Vorkath.

To being able to do Vorkath you need to have done Dragon Slayer 2 quest. (full completion)
I will try to guide you through the kills with this learner guide! 
This guide will also lead you through the quest Vorkath kill! The Vorkath kill in the quest is a little bit easyer then the Vorkath after the quest! 

What do we need as requirements?

I suggest 80 mage, 85 ranging atleast to get fast kills And for the defence bonusses i would say 80 combat stats. That means 80 att, str and defence. 
The higher your skills the higher the changes to kill Vorkath faster.

What do we need more?
We need full void atleast normal void. This means void hat,top,bottom and gloves!
We need a Dragon crossbow or better! Dragon hunter crossbow seems to be the best way to defeat vorkath. 
If you don't want to use a crossbow a blow pipe could be your best friend too!
Also verry usefull is a dragon fire shield(DFS). If you use a crosbow. But you can do it without a dfs and get a normal dragon fire shield. DFS (dragon fire shield) will improve you stats against range attacks.
As jewelry I suggest to get an archers ring imbued for better dps normal archers ring will do too but has a little less dps. 
Then as a necklace you really would use a salve amulet (ei) you can get the salve amulet by doing a quest. And then enchant it and use nightmare zone points to imbue it. This amulet makes kills go really allot faster its works better then a anquish amulet. 

When using a blow pipe I would suggest to wear a God blessing to for the +1prayer bonus.

Down below i will put some picture of the attacks his does and what the attack does to your character!

At the last pictures I show you the inventory and Armour setups for crossbow users and blow pipe users.

Because I don't have a melee set i dont post a melee set yet here!! 
BREATHES THAT VORKATH DOES
Normal fire breath! The attack is the same as iron, steel, mithril, adamant and rune dragons if you are standing on a distance.
<img>
Ice breath! This will freeze you character for a good 4 secs ish. Vorkath will spawn a minion you have to kill before it attacks you with the full 60 damage.

How to do this?
All you need is crumble undead. I use dust runes and chaos runes to perform this attack. 
When Vorkath freezes you... You quickly eat something or click down on the ground so you character stops attacking vorkath. ( i use f keys to make it faster) Click on mage book thing and use CRUMBLE UNDEAD on the minion. The minion will always get hit by 100 Damage and die instanly.

Once the minion is dead it takes 1 a 2 seconds before you can hit Vorkath again. So you can eat or use a potion before attacking Vorkath again
<img>
Venom Breathe. This breathe will poison you and you will get poisoned. Each time poison hits you it will hit more and more damage. ( Use anti-venom+ to make it stop, it will also less for 3 minutes ish. After 3 minutes drink again anti-venom+ if you are still fighting Vorkath) 
<img>
Poison explode on floor. What ever happend dont stand still! Keep walking from left to right and dont stand on the poison markers on the ground. Each time you stand on the poison Vorkath will get healed by the damage the poison that will hit you. I always try to look at the spread when he throws it so i know what way to walk! 
I always walk from west to east.

IF YOU WALK UP AND DOWN[south to north]  (THIS MEANS FROM ENTRANCE TO VORKATH YOU HAVE THE CHANGE TO GET ATTACKED BY MELEE FROM VORKATH!)

When walking between the poison spots you can turn off prayer once you feel confident enough about the walking between the potion spots. So you safe prayer points and use less prayer pots each run! 
<img>
The almighty dragon ball blast breathe. This attack can do up to 120 damage! This means you always have to walk away from it. How do we do this. The ball will hit the ground where you are standing so walk 2 tiles to the side of the ball and you wont get any damage.

REMEMBER: You CANT use any prayers against it to make the damage LESS!
<img>
And then there is Purple breathe! This breathe will put your prayer off!! So make sure you can click on quick pray when he does this attack. Just wait till it hits you. And click your quick prayers button next to the mini map!

Quick prayer should be when with blow pipe (mage,eagle eye.) With crossbow (range,eagle eye) reason because of your antifire shield that you can wear with the crossbow.
<img>
This blue ball is the magic attack of vorkath. When not pray magic this action can hit up to 40 as far as i know. But with a crossbow and dragon fire shield it wont hit that much that often! It could be sometimes that it will hit pretty desecent. So a high magic lvl to decrease the changes of hitting you is smart to have!
<img>
This gray spikey balls are the ranged attacks of Vorkath. You can pray ranged against it so you wont take any damage. I ONLY do this when i am with a crossbow to kill Vorkath. Cuz the dfs(Dragon fire shield, anti dragon fire shield)  and Extended super antifire potion will reduce the magic attacks damage!!!!
<img>
Now we gonna cover our armour and weapon. In this picture as we see i ll use:

- Void ranger helmet, Void top and bottom and Void gloves.
- As cape i wear a ava's assembler ( i used my first Vorkath head on it so it gets a little bit more attack bonus).
- As a necklace i use the Salve amullet (ei) 
- My ring slot is a archers ring (i) But a normal archers ring will do too. It only has less dps!
- My boots are Zamorak ranging boots. This is because of the prayer bonus it gives and it has good ranging stats too! (this slot can contain any god d hide boots you have or want to use)
- Then we also have an God blessing this dont matter what kind of blessing you use. I used the bandos one cuz it is one of the cheaperst ones there are out there! 
- Then as the final thing i wear is ofcourse the Blowpipe it contains 500 rune darts and 2k Zulrah scales
( each kill will cost you between 20 to max 50 rune darts and around 50 to 100 scales) It all depends on your damge output and your range level. It also matters what kind of ava's assembler you use. The higher tier of it the less darts you use! 


Once you hit 90+ range you always can use adamant darts to reduce the costs of a kill. But you dps will be lower so consider really good what you want.

This style of combat is used to kill Vorkath as fast as possible!! Downside is that the ranging attack really can fuck you up 
<img>
The inventory of this style of fight i ll use:

- 1x Ranging potion(4)   (can also be a devine ranging potion).
- 1x Extended super antifire(4) potion.
- 1x Anti-venom+ (4).
- 3x Prayer potion (4).
- Bandos godsword for the special attack that lowers the defence of Vorkath but the amount you hit him. (Bandos Godsword can be exchanged for a dragon warhammer)
- Void melee helmet.
- Rune pouch (this contains Dust runes and chaos runes, for Crumble undead)
- House teleport tablets.
- The rest we fill up sharks or any better food you want to use

- My boots are Zamorak ranging boots. This is because of the prayer bonus it gives and it has good ranging stats too! (this slot can contain any god d hide boots you have or want to use)
- Then we use as ranging ammo Ruby bolts (e) for the first 50 to 60% of vorkaths health. Those bolts can manage to hit up to 100 DAMAGE each time!
- Then as the weapon i wear a Armadyl crossbow.
- For the last item i wear a Dragon fire shield. This is for the breathe attacks
( Each kill will cost you between 15 to 30 Dragon diamond bolts (e) And Dragon bolts ruby (e) Bolts ) It all depends on your damge output and your range level. It also matters what kind of ava's assembler you use. The higher tier of it the less Bolts you use!
<img>
- 1x Ranging potion(4)   (can also be a devine ranging potion).
- 1x Extended anti-fire(4) potion. Because we wear a shield!
- 1x Anti-venom+ (4).
- 3x Prayer potion (4).
- Dragon diamond bolts (e) For the last 50 to 40 % Of Vorkaths health
- Rune pouch (this contains Dust runes and chaos runes, for Crumble undead) 
- House teleport tablets.
- The rest we fill up sharks or any better food you want to use

If you manage to die. Dont worry at Torfinn you will be able to collect all your items back for 100k. It sounds like allot of money... But in the long term you will gain the money 100% back

You also go to this guy to travel to Vorkath island!
<img>
If you use P O H (house portals) This is the way you have to walk. P O H is verry handy if you a pool in your house that restores special attack,health and prayer. 
Your house have to be in Relekka to use this option.

I Personally dont have this. But i have in my P O H an portal to Varrock Grand exchange(You need to have Varrock hard diaries done) And i have a prayer altar to restore prayer!

A other way how you can do this is using a duel ring in your inventory. Exchange that for 1 shark or food. Teleport to Clan Wars. Get through the white portal and teleport back. So you restore all your stats and special. But you will lose all the extra skill pot uses. 
This is why i recommend more the POH Portal with your own pool or altar and teleport to Varrock at the Grand exchange.

Another option is to have a teleport to Kharyrll (Canifis). The teleport will bring you also verry close to bank. Because it will teleport you to the pub south of the bank!

The lunar island teleport way

All you need for this way is to have done Lunar Diplomacy quest.
An lunar island portal in your house(this requires 69 magic)
And if possible the best restoration pool you can have to reduce the costs of suplies!

Now how does this works?
You use your home teleport to your owned house
Use your pool (If not restore stats and hp in bank on lunar island)
Run to your portal to lunar island. 
And get to bank! 
Now you talk to the most right banker in the bank.(he wont kick you of the island and allow you to bank)
After you did resupply on food and potions. Restored you hp and such.
You talk to anyone else on the island (this could be one of the other bankers. 
They will kick you off the island and you will get teleported to location on picture down below.
From there you run to Torfinn and travel to Vorkath island. 

This as been seen as the most effiency way to grind Vorkath!

EVERYONE! GOOD LUCK ON LOOT AND MAKING BANK! AND GETTING THAT PET!!!!😎 😎 💪
